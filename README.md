# Proof-of-Completion Badges

## Description
Proof-of-Completion Badges is a smart contract on the Aptos blockchain that allows admins to issue digital badges to users who successfully complete coding projects. These badges serve as immutable proof of accomplishment and can be verified on-chain by anyone.

## Vision
The goal of this project is to create a decentralized and verifiable system for acknowledging coding project completions. By leveraging blockchain technology, Proof-of-Completion Badges provides a trustless way for individuals to showcase their achievements, which can be recognized by employers, organizations, and the wider developer community.

## Future Scope
- **Integration with Learning Platforms:** Link with online coding platforms to automatically issue badges upon project completion.
- **NFT-Based Badges:** Convert badges into NFTs, enabling unique designs and enhanced usability.
- **Verification API:** Develop an API that allows third-party services to verify badge ownership easily.
- **Reputation System:** Build a ranking system based on the number and difficulty of completed projects.
- **Multi-Chain Support:** Expand to other blockchains for broader accessibility.

## Contract Details
- **Contract Address:** 0xf9e061852e3ee79a4009177ccc8ceb684fa2b6fc240853aa4e697aa9811a2462
